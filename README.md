Repository for the #mlzoomcamp Capstone Project 1

## Introduction

This Capstone project is to meet the Certificate requirements of the MLZoomCamp online course.

The project is based on the DataTalks.Club [KitchenWare](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kitchenware-classification/) classification competition. The competition is an image classification problem. As the name of the competition suggests, the goal is to correctly identify common kitchenware images using a machine learning model. We are given a training data set of image on which to train our model and a test data set on which we can rank the performance of our model. In this competition we need to classify images of different kitchenware items into 6 classes:

* cups
* glasses
* plates
* spoons
* forks
* knives

Full details about the competition is available at the link given above.
